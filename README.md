# gtm2-youtube-event-tracking

This Javascript file encased in `<script>` tags allows someone who is not a developer to "attach" this
script to html pages that have been enabled with Google Tag Manager. The following YouTube events are then generated: ENDED, PLAYING, PAUSED, BUFFERING, CUED. The events can then be analysed in Google Analytics.
