# gtm2-youtube-event-tracking

This Javascript file encased in <script> tags allows someone who is not a developer to "attach" this
script to html pages that have been enabled with Google Tag Manager. The following YouTube events are then generated: ENDED, PLAYING, PAUSED, BUFFERING, CUED. The events can then be analysed in Google Analytics.

This code is adapted from code written by Dan Wilkerson of [Lunametrics](http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2015/05/11/updated-youtube-tracking-google-analytics-gtm) [Github](http://www.lunametrics.com/blog/2015/05/11/updated-youtube-tracking-google-analytics-gtm)
